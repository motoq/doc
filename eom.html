<A HREF="https://github.com/motoq/eom/">eom</A> library provides
astrodynamics related functionality that can aid in the rapid
development of analysis tools.  The
<A HREF="https://github.com/motoq/eom/">eomx</A> application is included
with the library.  It is a command line program driven by a simple text
based input file.  From the command line, eomx is invoked by

<PRE>
eomx eomx_input_file.txt iers_eop_file.txt
</PRE>

where the <A HREF="https://datacenter.iers.org/eop.php/">IERS EOP</A>
file

<PRE>iers_eop_file.txt</PRE>

is optional.  When not included, IERS EOP values (polar motion, UT1-UTC,
LOD, corrections to the reduction theory) are all set to zero.  The
<B>.csv</B> formatted <B>finals.daily (IAU2000)</B> or
<B>finals.all (IAU2000)</B> files are supported.  Note values from these
files are separated by semicolons, not commas.  The first row is composed
of column labels.  The files are available at the top of the page from
the <i>version metadata</i> links, not the unformatted <i>latest version</i>
link.

<A NAME="Overview"></A><H3>Input File Overview</H3>

The eomx input files are composed of statements that define the
simulation scenario.  Some statements define the period of interest and
general environment settings.  Others create named objects.  Command
statements then operate on those objects.
<P>
Each statement is terminated by a semicolon.  This allows for an object
definition to have multiple optional settings when default values are
not desired.  Default values will typically be based on the most simple
or computationally least expensive options.  Higher fidelity options
typically need to be enabled.
<P>
Comments begin with the <B>#</B> sign and are effective until the end of
a line.  The general formatting is free text.  White space between
values or between lines is ignored.  The end of inputs can be marked
with the <B>end;</B> statement.
<P>
Some statements are configured to allow for multiple options, but
currently only support one input type.  For example, date and time
inputs require the user to specify <B>GD</B> indicating the time format
is Gregorian date, despite this being the only accepted input format.
That is because the input language is a work in progress, and options
are being added as needed.

Here is an example input file that creates two orbits:

end;

#      CART  GCRF      0.05     0.7     0.4  -1.2     0.02    0.3;

With no commands acting on the orbits, the output is limited indicating
scenario settings and regurgitating the input orbit definitions:

The <q>dt eps</q> output indicates the amount of time that is considered
to be zero when encountering boundary problems due to numerical round-off
when locating time based tabulated values.  For example, when looking up
ephemeris interpolation objects, if the maximum time associated with the
interpolator is 60 seconds, and the time computed for interpolation is
less than 60+eps seconds, then the end node point of the interpolator
will be used instead of throwing an exception.
<P>
Computational distance and time units are the earth relative canonical
DU and TU.  One DU is defined by the gravitational scaling radius of the
system gravity model (EGM 2008 as of 2023).  One DU and the earth's
gravitational parameter define the Herg, or one TU.  One ER is the
semimajor axis length used to define the WGS 84 ellipsoid used for the
transformation from ITRF Cartesian to geodetic (latitude, longitude,
altitude) coordinates.
<P>
Default input units are DU, TU, and radians.  <q>Sticky</q> modifier
statements allow different units to be defined.  For example, before the
first orbit definition above, the default units are changed to be
kilometers and seconds.  At other times, units are specified within the
input statement itself.

Gregorian date with 24 hour time, UTC.  Valid year, month and day values
are expected.  Time values are not bound to the standard 24 hour, 60
minutes, and 60 second limits.  They are accumulated relative to 00:00:00 UTC.
Only the seconds field supports fractional values - all others are integers.
