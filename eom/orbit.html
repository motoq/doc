<A NAME="Orbit"></A><H3>Orbit Definition</H3> 

Orbit definitions are named objects.  They are defined by the Orbit
keyword, the name of the object, epoch time, state vector, and
propagator.  General perturbation (GP) methods require no further
inputs.  Special Perturbation (SP) methods may include force model
and integration method options.  If not specified, the force model will
default to two-body gravity with propagation via RK4 integration.  Two
examples will aid in understanding the input options to be described.

The Orbit keyword is followed by a unique identifier, the orbit name.
The <A HREF="#PropagatorModel">orbit propagation model</A> is next, followed by
the epoch using a <A HREF="#DateTime">DateTime</A> input option.  The
<A HREF="#StateVectorType">state vector type</A> and 
<A HREF="#ReferenceFrame">reference frame</A> follow.  The final entry
for GP propagation models is the state vector itself.  The DistanceUnits
and TimeUnits keywords affect these entries.  SP methods can also
include <A HREF="#Gravity">GravityModel</A>
include <A HREF="#MoonGravity">MoonGravity</A>
include <A HREF="#SunGravity">SunGravity</A>
and <A HREF="#Integrator">Propagator (Numerical Integration)</A> method.

<Q>Kepler1</Q> two-body GP model based off of Vinti's work and implemented
by Gim J. Der and Herbert B. Reynolds, original available via
<A HREF="https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/suppl/10.2514/4.866487/">AIAA</A>.

<Q>Vinti6</Q> GP model with full J2 and partial J3 zonal effects, based off
Vinti's work and implemented by Gim J. Der and Herbert B. Reynolds,
original available via
<A HREF="https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/suppl/10.2514/4.866487/">AIAA</A>.
Unlike most analytic propagators, the Vinti model is initialized with
state vectors, or those derived directly from osculating element sets
(vs. mean element sets).  For more information, see
<Q>Orbital and Celestial Mechanics</Q>, Nino L. Bonavito, Gim J. Der, and
John P. Vinti, AIAA, 1998.

The <Q>Vinti6</Q> model described above, but limited to only the J2
zonal spherical harmonic.  A true J2 propagator (vs. the typical secular
versions requiring mean element sets).

The <Q>Vinti6</Q> model described above, but limited to only the J2
zonal spherical harmonic.  A true J2 propagator (vs. the typical secular
versions requiring mean element sets).  This version differs from
<Q>VintiJ2</Q> in that it has been reworked, fully separating
initialization from propagation, increasing computational efficiency.

Special perturbations methods.  The equations of motion are resolved
through the use of numerical integration.


<A NAME="OrbitRelative"></A><H3>Relative Orbit Definition</H3> 

Allows for a relative orbit to be specified based on a <I>RTC</I>
relative bounding box and transverse distance offset.  The method is
based on <Q>Spacecraft Relative Orbit Geometry Description Through Orbit
Element Differences</Q> by Hanspeter Schaub.  This method of defining a
bounding box and offset automatically guarantees the energy matching
constraint.  The resulting orbit definitions are propagated in inertial
space, not a linearized reference frame intended for control systems
only.  This method is not limited to circular orbits.

<P>

The syntax is:

<P style="background-color:LightCyan;">
<font face = "courier">
<B>RelativeOrbit</B> <I>orbit_name template_orbit_name RTC
dR dT dC deltaT</I>
</font>
</P>

The values <I>dR dT dC</I> define the <I>desired</I> bounding box limits
of the relative orbit.  Some values may be exceeded to meet minimum
values.  The <I>deltaT</I> parameter is an along-track offset between
the orbit centers.


<A NAME="OrbitEph"></A><H3>External Ephemerides</H3> 

Externally generated SP3c is the only format currently supported for
ingestion.  Examples of loading <I>SP3c</I> formatted
ephemeris from the file <I>nsgf.orb.lageos2.210626.v70.sp3</I> with
orbit names <I>nsgf_lageos2h</I> and <I>nsgf_lageos2t</I> are:

<PRE>
EphemerisFile nsgf_lageos2h  SP3c Hermite nsgf.orb.lageos2.210626.v70.sp3;
EphemerisFile nsgf_lageos2t  SP3c Chebyshev nsgf.orb.lageos2.210626.v70.sp3;
</PRE>

<I>Hermite</I> interpolation is performed for the first entry.  Each
interpolator is fit to two state vectors (position and velocity) with
acceleration generated by a simple J4 gravity model.  Hermite
interpolation assumes velocity is the derivative of position, and should
therefore be suitable for externally generated precision ephemerides.
This assumption would not necessarily be valid for ephemererides generated
via analytic (GP) propagation methods.  The assumption that a J4 gravity
model is sufficient to improve the fit must also be valid (typically a
very good assumption).  The resulting 5th order polynomial explicitly
maintains continuity through acceleration and smoothness through
velocity.  Continuity and smoothness are implicitly maintained to higher
degrees than the 2nd derivative.

Chebyshev interpolation currently fits position and velocity separately,
eliminating the requirement that velocity be the derivative of position.
This interpolation method currently fits 9 points to an 8th order
polynomial, ensuring endpoints match between polynomials.  More
refinement to the implementation is expected, most likely through the
fitting of more points with endpoint matching constraints.
