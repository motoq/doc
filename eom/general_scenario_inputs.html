SimStart indicates the start time of the scenario.  A

LeapSeconds indicates the number of leap seconds to be used.  This is
the positive integer TAI-UTC.  A default value of 37 seconds was used as
of Jan 2023.  The value is typically not critical as it only affects slowly
changing states dependent on terrestrial time, such as the ephemerides of
celestial bodies.  For example, precession and nutation transformations
can be computed with TAI-UTC equal to zero without affecting accuracy.
An error in TAI-UTC will have a greater impact on sun, lunar, and
planetary ephemerides, although the state of celestial objects changes
relatively slowly and is often computed using lower accuracy analytic
methods.  TAI-UTC is typically only important when inputting (or
outputting) GPS time values.

<B>EcfEciRate</B> <I><A HREF="duration.html">Duration</A></I>
</font>
</P>
EcfEciRate sets the rate at which ECF to ECI transformations will be
generated.  Over the duration of the scenario, precession, nutation, and
EOP transformations are compuated at this rate and stored.  When
required by the eom library, interpolation is used to form the precise
transformation at a given time.  The modern CIO method allows a rate of
1 set of transformations per day to be suitable for most high precision
needs.  For computational efficiency, when running Monte Carlo
simulations, setting the EcfEciRate to 0 results in the generation of a
single set of transformations, eliminating the need for interpolation.
