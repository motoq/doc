<H1>Access Analysis to Ground Points</H1>
</DIV>


Access analysis from a ground point to an orbit can be defined with the
<I>GroundPoint</I> keyword:

<P style="background-color:LightCyan;">
<font face = "courier">
<B>Access  GroundPointAccess</B> <I>AccessModel orbit_name
ground_point_name</I>
</font>
</P>

Two access models are supported.  The <I>Standard</I> model uses a
variable step size based on the rate of change in true anomaly to
locate the next access window.  Once the access window is located, a
bisection method is used to refine the precise rise and set times.
This method is robust and fast.  A significantly slower <I>Debug</I>
option is also available that uses a small fixed step size to search
for access windows.

By default, access is generated based on line if sight visibility from
the ground point to the satellite.  This occurs when the elevation of
the satellite w.r.t. the  ground point, relative to the plane tangent to
the ellipsoid, is zero.  Currently, only the minimum elevation is
configurable through an additional line:
<P style="background-color:LightCyan;">
<font face = "courier">
<I>MinimumElevation d</I>
</font>
</P>

The following illustrates creating a ground point location named
<I>gp01</I> where positive latitude implies north and positive longitude
implies east.  Access to this location by a satellite named
<I>leosat</I> is to be performed with a minimum ground elevation
constraint of -5 degrees.
