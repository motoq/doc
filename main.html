<A NAME="ab"></A><H2>VSE</H2> The Vehicle Simulation Environment (VSE)
library consists of classes designed to aid in building and propagating
vehicle models.  A model is a system of differential equations and
propagation generally means integrating this system over time.  The
library also contains utilities to display the model state in a Java3D
environment (multiple models can be loaded at once).  The simulation
environment is built as needed to support models of interest.  Although
this project is still a work in progress, the decision to make it
available is based on the belief that it may be of use, especially to
those taking a simulation and controls class.  A quick introduction to a
simple <A HREF="#orbiter">orbiting body simulation</A> is given
<A HREF="orbiter.html">here</A>.  It is hoped this description, along with
comments in the code, will be enough to get someone started.

<A NAME="jv"></A><H2>The 3D environment</H2> The Java3D API was
initially chosen for visualization  because it was well documented
compared to other options available at the time.  In addition, the
object oriented scene graph API is relatively easy to learn for those
with no OpenGL programming experience.  Although it may not offer the
flexibility required to build a <I>cutting edge</I> 3D game, for those
who are more interested in modeling and simulation (math and physics)
and want to display information in a highly configurable OpenGL
environment, without spending the time to fully delve into graphics
programming, Java3D is the way to go.

<P>

As with all extensions to the Java language, the future of Java3D is
uncertain.  Further development of the Java3D API has been on hold since
2008.  If another 3D environment assumes long term dominance, a conversion
to that API should not be all that difficult as all VSE graphics dependence
is contained within a single package path.  One thing to keep in mind - while
other 3D graphics packages for Java have come and gone over more than
two decades, Java3D is still here and working well on a large variety of
hardware and operating systems.  This set of libraries has been tested
on multiple versions of Linux and Windows, both 32 and 64 bit.

<P>

Controls for each environment will depend on the model in use.  However,
unless the mouse has been remapped in the operating system, the left mouse
button will rotate the view while the right mouse button will pan.  If a scroll
wheel is available, it will control zoom - otherwise, the middle mouse button
can be used to zoom in and out.

<P>

Mesh models have been built with 
<A HREF="http://www.misfitcode.com/misfitmodel3d/">Misfit Model 3D</A>.
I am barely competent at using it, so my solid models are very basic....


<A NAME="in"></A><H2>Requirements & Installation</H2> This project is
currently built with <A HREF="http://java.com/">Java</A> 1.8.0_102 and
<A HREF="http://java3d.java.net/">java3D</A> 1.5.2.  Earlier
versions of Java3D should work (I believe  Java3D 1.3.1 is sufficient).
However no back testing has been performed.  Java 1.6.0 or greater is
most likely required.  Java3D may still report a warning message with older
graphics cards, misinterpreting the version of GLX in use.  This message
can usually be ignored.

<P>

Java and Java3D installation procedures are best handled by the instructions
from their respective download pages.  Because installation will differ from
one OS to another, I will not attempt to describe it here.

<P>

To launch a model in a simulation, it is necessary to install and
compile the
<A HREF="https://github.com/motoq/vse">Vehicle Simulation Environment</A>.
Note the full path is "com.motekew.vse".

<PRE>
vseLib-20080930.jar
</PRE>

If the JAR file is not going to be extracted, it is probably easiest to
rename or link it to "vseLib.jar" once downloaded.  This way, the CLASSPATH
environmental variable does not need to be modified each time a new version
is downloaded.

<P>

Installation of the library involves copying the JAR file to whatever
location you like and adding it to your CLASSPATH.  How you add it to your
CLASSPATH will depend, once again, on the operating system you are using
and the environment in which Java is run (command line, shortcut, IDE, etc...).
From the command line, in Linux (bash), you would add the following line to
your .profile (or similar):

<PRE>
export CLASSPATH=.:/usr/local/javalibs/vseLib.jar:$CLASSPATH
</PRE>

This sets your CLASSPATH environmental variable to include the current
directory, the path to vseLib.jar (assuming you copied it to
/usr/local/javalibs/), and to include the old CLASSPATH.  Sometimes it
is easiest to create a simple script that includes a classpath
parameter instead of modifying environmental variables (especially
under Windows).

<P>

Each individual model package follows the same naming convention and is
installed in a similar fashion.  For example, if the library is installed in
/usr/local/javalibs/, and the model is installed in my home directory "kurt",
then the update to my CLASSPATH would be:

<PRE>
export
CLASSPATH=.:/usr/local/javalibs/vseLib.jar:/home/kurt/modeling/orbiter.jar:$CLASSPATH
</PRE>

Models, along with classes used to run them in a simulation, are
packaged individually as libraries.  The primary class in each model
package implements an interface needed to start the simulation.  This
class either needs to be instantiated within a custom application to
run, or launched directly with the included RunVSE application (located
in RunVSE-YYYYMMDD.jar).  This JAR file can either be added to the
CLASSPATH, or the RunVSE.class file can be extracted from the jar file
with the command:

<PRE>
jar xvf RunVSE.jar RunVSE.class
</PRE>

In addition, utilities than can open .zip files can often open .jar
files.  Either way, the simulation can be run with the command:

<PRE>
java RunVSE simulation_primary_class_name
</PRE>

For the above command, if the RunVSE.class was extracted from the
RunVSE.jar file, then it is assumed this class resides in the current
directory.  Otherwise, the RunVSE.jar file needs to be added to your
CLASSPATH.  Also, the "simulation_primary_class_name" includes the full
package path to the model (see models below for the exact syntax to launch
each).  Note that no class path is needed for the RunVSE application
because it was built under the default package.

<P>

<B>In Summary</B>, vseLib.jar and RunVSE.jar should be downloaded and
added to your CLASSPATH to run any of the models included in this project.
All source code is included within each JAR file.

<P>

<A NAME="md"></A><H2>Simulation Models</H2>

<H3>1DOF  Mass Spring Damper Simulation</H3>
This is a very simple single degree of freedom model representing the
classic mass, spring, damper system.  <B>MassSpDp3D</B>, the main class,
can be run with the following statement from the command line:

<PRE>
java RunVSE com.motekew.msd3d.MassSpDp3D
</PRE>

When run, it will ask for the mass, spring constant,
and damping properties, along with the initial conditions.  The following are
reasonable values to start with:

<PRE>
Mass (Kg):  5.0
Spring constant (N/m):  1.0
Damping (N/(m/s)):  0.5
Initial position (m):  7.5
Initial velocity (m/s):  0.0
Start time (s):  0.0
</PRE>

There is only one control for this model - the right arrow will increment
a constant force in the positive X direction and the left arrow will increment
the force in the negative X direction.  This force is set to zero at the start
of the simulation.  The above initial conditions can be replicated by setting
the initial position to zero and incrementing the force with the right
arrow 15 times.  This results in 7.5 units of force, that will pull the mass
7.5 units along the X-axis.  Once the system dampens out, either the up or down
arrow will zero the force, causing the mass to be released so it can oscillate
about the origin.

<A NAME="orbiter"></A><H3>6DOF Orbiter Simulation</H3>

<BR>
<DIV ALIGN="center">
  <IMG SRC="nadir_orbiter2.png" ALT="Sparky Leveling Off">

<BR>

This is a relatively simple six degree of freedom simulation.  The vehicle
model is for a spacecraft subject to the gravitational attraction of a
rotating central body.  The spacecraft can only thrust along its
longitudinal axis, propelling itself forward - the attitude of the
vehicle must be changed to alter direction.  Torques can be applied
about each axis (via thrusters, reaction wheels, magic, take your pick).
Note that gyroscopic coupling results in an acceleration about a third
axis when there are angular rates about two others.  In addition, due to
a single plane of symmetry in the spacecraft mass distribution, torques
applied about an axis other than the y-axis (pitch) will induce
accelerations along the other axes.  This coupling can make the vehicle
very difficult to control if the angular rates are anything but slow.

<P>

When launched, this simulation presents a startup window where the user
can enter the gravitational parameter, gravitational scaling radius, and
the rotation rate of the central body.  The scale factor affects the
size of the solid model representing the orbiter.  A limited number of
gravitational coefficients may also be entered.  Check the "Normalized"
checkbox when entering normalized coefficients (Kaula normalization is
used).  No error checking is performed on these values - user beware.

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="center">
  <IMG SRC="startup.png" ALT="Startup Window">
</DIV>
<P>

The <B>Use Earth Model</B> option loads real earth values using distance
units of meters and time units of seconds.  On the display axes, one
distance unit is equal to the gravitational scaling radius value.  Given
the very small integration step size used for the real time simulation,
it is recommended that the <B>Canonical Earth Model</B> option be used
in conjunction with <B>Use Earth Model</B>.

<P>

The display axes calibrations are the corresponding distance units (DU),
with 1 DU equal to the gravitational scaling radius of the central body.
Time is then in TU, time units.  With canonical units, if the central
body were an object such as the asteroid 433 Eros, one TU would then be
equal to 50.5 minutes.  For the earth, one TU is just under 13.5
minutes.  The default spacecraft mass is set to 1 with a compatible
inertia tensor and control input magnitudes.  This results in "real
time" attitude rates no matter how TU maps to real world time.

<P>

The <B>Orbiter Configuration</B> window, shown below, is comprised of three
primary panels.  The top section controls execution of the simulation
driving the models.  The play button (">") moves time forward, while the
pause button ("||") halts execution allowing the user to modify
settings in the middle tabbed pane section.  The bottom panel allows the
user to activate different attitude control options during execution.

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="center">
  <IMG SRC="nadir_acw.png" ALT="Control System Inputs">
</DIV>
<P>

The <B>Orbiter</B> tab allows the user to adjust orbital
parameters and the mass properties of the spacecraft.  The user is allowed
to create orbits that may result in computational problems.  For
example, setting the semi-major axis too close to the radius of the
central body creates some interesting results that have not been
investigated yet.  Simply pausing the simulation and changing the
orbital elements to something reasonable fixes this.

<P>

Four attitude control settings (five, if you count OFF) are available.
When the <B>Stability Control</B> button is selected, the control law
drives the body axes angular rates to zero by applying appropriate
torques derived from a feedback control system.  It essentially damps
all angular movement.  When no user input torques are applied, the
system will bring any changes in attitude to a halt.  When the user
applies torques via the keyboard controls to turn the spacecraft, the
attitude control system makes the spacecraft significantly easier to
maneuver (at the expense of being a bit more sluggish).

<P>

The <B>Inertial (rest-to-rest)</B> attitude control setting orients the
spacecraft to a desired heading, elevation, and bank, relative to the
inertial X-Y-Z axes.  The aerospace sequence is followed for these Euler
angles - yaw about the Z-axis, pitch about the new Y-axis, and finally
roll about the new X-axis.

<P>

The <B>Orbit RPY (dynamic)</B> attitude option orients the spacecraft
relative to what is often called the Roll Pitch Yaw frame.  It is a
local level reference frame in which the Z-axis points towards nadir.
The Y-axis is orthogonal to the orbit plane.  The X-axis is within the
orbit plane, positive in the same direction as the inertial velocity
vector.  The RPY reference frame is dynamic in nature - the spacecraft
must constantly rotate in attempt to maintain the desired attitude.  As
it is currently implemented, the control system is completely
reactionary, with no predictive modeling.  Because of this, the actual
attitude will slightly lag the desired one depending on how quickly the
spacecraft orbits the central body.  For example, aligning the
spacecraft body axes with the RPY reference frame will result in zero
yaw and roll while a slight pitch will always be present.  The smaller
the semi-major axes, the more noticeable the offset.

<P>

The <B>Reference Point</B> options are similar to the <B>Orbit RPY
(dynamic)</B> setting except a reference point is used in conjunction
with the central body to determine the frame in which attitude is
measured.  See com.motekew.orbiter.OrbiterSys for more details on the
constraints behind these options.  The <B>Central Body</B> tab allows
the location of the reference point to be set (the default location
coincides with the central body).

<P>

The <B>Don't Apply  Attitude Correction</B> checkbox zeros control
system torques within the model.  The control system is active,
computing yaw, pitch, roll, and corrective torques.  However, the
corrections are not applied.

<P>

Damping controls how aggressively the control law will retard angular
motion, while Stiffness affects how much torque is applied given the
difference between the desired and current attitudes.  More details on
these matrices and the control law theory in use can be found in
"Rigid-Body Attitude Control Using Rotation Matrices for Continuous,
Singularity-Free Control Laws," in the June 2011 IEEE Control Systems
Magazine.  In the future, more information will be added here regarding
the control law gain matrices.

<P>

Attitude is specified in Euler angles because they are easy to
understand and visualize.  Deviations from the desired Euler angles are
listed in the Yaw, Pitch, and Roll fields.  Uz, Uy, and Ux are the
torques applied by the attitude control system (user inputs are not
included).

<P>

The body axes are aligned such that the X-axis goes through the nose of
the spacecraft while the Z-axis is through the top.  The Y-axis
therefore points out the port "wing".  This orientation is slightly
unfashionable now days given positive pitch results in a nose-down
orientation for aircraft.  However, Z should point up.  In addition,
since the top of an orbiter would generally face towards the central
body, falling upside down, positive pitch results in an angle above
local level.

<P>

No attitude control optimization has been implemented.  There are also
no limits on the magnitudes of the corrective torques applied by the
control system.  Attitude quaternions generated by propagation of the
model state are passed to the control law.  Attitude sensor simulation
and attitude determination from sensor models have not yet been
implemented.

<P>

A new option (not shown - the image will be updated when work on this
functionality is complete) is the attitude determination tab <B>ADS</B>.
Currently, it allows the user to set the orientation of three simulated star
trackers relative to that of the spacecraft body.  The single axis
angular uncertainty for each sensor may also be set, along with the
conewidth dictating the field of view for each sensor.  This section is
still under development - error checking on limits is very basic at this
time.

<P>

Upon selecting the <B>Estimate Attitude</B> button, the current time will
be displayed along with the true inertial attitude.  In addition, the
attitude, as determined by the TRIAD algorithm, is displayed.  This is
used as an initial guess for a very simple weighted least squares
estimate of the orbiter attitude.

<P>

Additional details on the structure of this model can be found
<A HREF="orbiter.html">here</A>.

<P>

<B>Orbiter</B> is the main class and can be run from the command line with the
statement:

<PRE>
java RunVSE com.motekew.orbiter.Orbiter
</PRE>

The Model State Viewer (not pictured here - see Screenshot) is a window
that displays the current simulation time, the model state vector, the
controls, and the output vector.  This is a raw output window generated
by the Orbiter model (in contrast to the Orbiter Configuration window
that is separate from the model, implemented as part of the simulation).
The State Vector is as follows:

<PRE>
X:   X-axis position (DU)
Y:   Y-axis position (DU)
Z:   Z-axis position (DU)
DX:  X-axis velocity (DU/TU)
DY:  Y-axis velocity (DU/TU)
DZ:  Z-axis velocity (DU/TU)
Q0:  Scalar component of Quaternion attitude
QI:  1st vector component of Quaternion attitude
QJ:  2nd vector component of Quaternion attitude
QK:  3rd vector component of Quaternion attitude
P:   Rotation rate about body X-axis (rad/sec)
Q:   Rotation rate about body Y-axis (rad/sec)
R:   Rotation rate about body Z-axis (rad/sec)
</PRE>

Torques and rotations all follow the right hand rule.  The
Control vector contains only user inputs (no control system inputs):

<PRE>
FX:   X-axis force
FY:   Y-axis force
FZ:   Z-axis force
TX:   Torque about X-axis
TY:   Torque about Y-axis
TZ:   Torque about Z-axis
</PRE>

The Output Vector:

<PRE>
A:      Semi-major axis (DU)
E:      Eccentricity
I:      Inclination (rad)
O:      Right Ascension of the Ascending Node (rad)
W:      Argument of Periapsis (rad)
V:      True Anomaly (rad)
BANK:   Bank (rad)
ELEV:   Elevation (rad)
HEAD:   Heading (rad)
</PRE>

The state vector labels are automatically generated from the
Enumerations used to represent them.  Bank, elevation, and heading are
relative to the RPY reference frame when a central body has been
initialized.  When a central body is not present, these Euler angles are
relative to the inertial X-Y-Z axes.  For either case, as stated above,
the rotation order follows that of the standard Aerospace sequence.

<P>

The values corresponding to A, E, I, O, W, V are the Keplerian orbital
elements.  They will be non-zero when a central body has been
initialized.  All angular values displayed in the  Model State Viewer
are in radians (in contrast to the Orbiter Configuration window).
